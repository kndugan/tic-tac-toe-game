# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Description

In this project, I've used React to create a Tic Tac Toe game. Each Player will have alternate turns to place an X or O on the board. The first player to get 3 X's or O's in a row is the winner. Once the game is over, a screen will pop up to restart a new game.

The starter code was provided by Sufa Digital Media and React.

## How to Run

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

Future improvements will include keeping track of which player's turn it is and a time duration for each turn.
